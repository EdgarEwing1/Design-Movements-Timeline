                <h1>Gothic Revival </h1>
                <h3>1830 - 1860</h3>
                <img src="Strawberry hill image.jpeg" width="100%">
                <p>In the 1800s, the Industrial Revolution brought change to the design world, though for many, it was positive; some were less appreciative of the new industrial style. Many talented designers sought a return to medieval architecture. These designers, known as revivalists, saw the need for churches as religion expanded and began building them in the old medieval style. These churches were built to impress god and incorporated High roofs, tall spires, pinnacles, pointed arches, gargoyles, repeated patterns and crosses into their architecture. Sir George Gilbert Scott was at the forefront of Gothic Revival, who designed over 800 buildings, most of which were churches. Despite his work being synonymous with churches, Scott wanted Gothic Revival to appear on all types of buildings, regardless of whether it was a secular building or not. Some of his most notable buildings had no relation to religion, for example, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Midland Grand Hotel. It wasn't just Gilbert Scott's buildings which were non-religious. The first recorded example of Gothic Revival design was in the Strawberry Hill building, the home of a writer called Horace Walpole. Walpole wasn't the only person who lived in a gothic building; as the movement continued, wealthy aristocrats would buy gothic buildings. The most famous being William Beckford, who brought Font Hill House. Eventually, the Gothic Revival even bleed into society, creating gothic culture. It also wasn't the only revival happening at the time and soon gave way to the equally essential arts and crafts movement. </p>

            <h1>Arts and Crafts</h1>
            <h3>1861 - 1920</h3>
            <img src="arto.webp" width="100%">
            <p>The Arts and Crafts movement emerged in the 1860s as a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, much like the Gothic Revival movement. The steam train and other inventions of the time led to the development of many factories. As a result, more and more products were mass-produced, with designers paying less consideration to personalisation than before. This upset many wealthy people at the time who longed for a return of the time when products were handcrafted with care. One man, troubled by this change, decided to rebel. This man was William Morris, a British designer who firmly believed this new technology removed skill from design. As part of this rebellion, Morris founded Morris and Co. in 1861 with the goal of raising design to the level of art. The bespoke wallpaper and stained glass that Morris and Co. produced quickly gained popularity, which in turn helped the Arts and Crafts movement take off. Before long, designers adopted Morrissâ€™s style and ethics and started developing similar products, including furniture and home items. Morriss's approach to design helped shape the Arts and Crafts movement's intricate style, which makes use of
              Floral patterning, asymmetry, simple shapes and an emphasis on craftsmanship.
              We see these elements in design to this day. Indeed, many argue that the Arts and Crafts movement never stopped, with its themes echoed in the modern Cottage Core design style. The movement's rich history and future make it one of history's most influential and exciting design movements.

            <h1>De Stijl</h1>
            <h3>1917 - 1931</h3>
            <img src="Destijl.jpeg" width="100%">
            <p>"The style," or De Stijl, was a design movement initiated in 1917 by Dutch artists and designers such as Gerrit Rietveld, Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg. Despite its Dutch origin, Destijl found its place in America after a Mondrian visited the country. In America, it was taken up by abstract artists, helping the style further evolve. De Stijl products are easily recognised by their distinctive crisp black lines and the use of shapes filled with primary colours and separated by white spaces. De Stijl products are designed simplistically and function beautifully. Its minimalism makes it vastly different from the Art Deco period. The style, though unique, poses similarities to Bahuas, another prominent movement happening in Europe at almost exactly the same time. Both movements focus on function over form and use simple geometric design. De Stijl products can still be recognised now, and though less common, the movement inspired other movements that have left an even more significant impact on our world. It's an inspirational and unique style.

            <h1>Bauhaus</h1>
            <h3>1919 - 1933 </h3>
            <img src="bauhaus-art-thumbnail.jpeg" width="100%">
            <p>The story of Bauhaus begins with the Bauhaus design school. Founded in 1919 by Walter Gropius, the Bauhaus design school taught its students in a radical new way. Students at the Bauhaus school were taught multiple design skills (From printing to graphic design) with the aim that future designers would work across various disciplines. Bauhaus quickly became one of the most successful art schools in the world and evolved into more than a school. Bauhaus became a design movement. Bauhaus designers believed in a unification of art.
              Additionally, designers in the movement valued function much more than form; as a result, Bauhaus products were minimalist. Designers strived for Geometric purity in their products and would use sharp and angular lines in their designs. Ornamentation was considered a needless indulgence; for that reason, most Bauhaus products used monochrome or simple colours. The epitome of Bauhaus design is the Cantilever Chair. The Cantilever Chair was designed by Marcel Breuer. Breuer drew inspiration from the steel tubes on bicycles to create his chair that was held by a single curving piece of metal rather than four legs. Another great example of Bauhaus design is the brutalist architecture seen in the cities of East Berlin. Bauhaus represented innovation and progress at a time when German politics was regressing. Unfortunately, the Buahuas school was closed as a result of Nazi pressure. Even though the movement formally ended with the school's closure in 1933, it lives on to this day through the design products it inspired

            <h1>American Industrial Design</h1>
            <h3>1939 - 1965</h3>
            <img src="car.jpeg" width="100%">
            <p>Do you know why iPhones break after five years? Why consumerism began? Or even why toasters are shiny? The answer to these questions is the same: it's all because of the American Industrial Design movement. The story begins in the 1920s after the great depression. With businesses failing and unemployment rising, people no longer wanted to buy things in the same way as before. As the years ticked by, industrialists searched for new ways to encourage people to return to the shops. The answer to their problems came from technology with stamping and moulds, giving designers new materials to create products with, such as Vinyl, chrome and plywood. Bel Geddes, a pioneer of American industrial design, introduced Utilitarian art: the idea of using such materials to create sleek and streamlined products representing innovation. The use of flashy chrome on toasters and flames on cars encouraged people to return to spending. Bel Geddes' Futurama exhibit in the 1939 World Art Fair claimed to be building the world of tomorrow. The exhibit told designers what they already knew: it was a new era of design. Soon, the American Industrial Design Movement was in full swing, with sales booming and mass consumption taking off. Form became equal to function. Designers took care to make products look great so that people would buy them. This was aided by adverts which would boast all the ways a product could change your life regardless of how mundane the product might seem. With all of this drive for people to own products, consumerism was born. The idea that we must own products to express both taste and status. One influential designer who capitalised on consumerism was Raymond Lowey. Raymond Lowey's designs, which mixed clean lines, Art Deco style, and industrialism, represented the future of design for both America and the world. As a whole, American industrial design has influenced more than just the way we design things. It has influenced our whole philosophy of manufacturing, making it a hugely important part of this timeline.

            <h1>Modernism</h1>
            <h3>1940 - 1970</h3>
            <img src="home.jpeg" width="100%">
            <p>As the traumatic scars left by World War II faded, an exciting new design movement began to appear called modernism. Modernists sought to forget the recent war and reinterpret history so that they could see the world in a new way. In this sense, modernism was more than a design movement as it spanned all creative sectors: modernists aimed to design a better society and they were using new technology to do it. As materials like Glass, Concrete and Steel became more commonplace  modernists work began to really take off. Modernist designers would use these materials and wood to create products that curved in a way that drew inspiration from nature. Modernists used both pale colours, such as the soft tones of light blue, as well as the more striking hues of gold brown and green. Despite their use of colour, most modernists shifted towards a focus on function and considered too much decoration to be pointless. This shift resulted in a strong belief in celebrating human creativity and intelligence. One blinding light of the modernist movement is Alvar Aalto. Inspired by the Finnish forests in which he grew up, Aalto left an everlasting impact on modernism through his designs, which used land features, natural lighting and natural materials. Modernism permeated through society, and its effect can still be seen today. Eventually, however, it would succumb to the new Post-Modernist movement.

            <h1>Postmodernism</h1>
            <h3>1972 - Present Day</h3>
            <img src="ve.jpeg" width="100%">
            <p>The destruction of the modernist building Pruitt Igoeâ€™ marked the beginning of a new design period: Postmodernism. For post-modernists, this symbolic event meant that modernism had truly failed. Postmodernists began rebuilding design in the way that they wanted. But what kind of well did they want exactly? For post-modernists, design was about style, and extra ornamentation was valued far higher than in the modernist movement. The post-modernist approach starkly contrasted that of modernists, whose designs they considered bland, post modernist products were made to provoke thought in its audience by challenging ideas using anarchy. The Las Vegas trip is an excellent example of post-modernist design with its bright colours and urban landscapes. Other postmodernist design features are the use of sleek lines, symmetry in objects, the use of glossy plastics and chrome metals and vivid colours. Postmodernism continues to this day in the sense that we still reuse old styles to create something new, a common trend in postmodern design. As a result, we see Postmodernism everywhere, making it the most important design style of the 20th and 21st centuries.

            <img src="mem.webp" width="100%">
            <p>The most famous designer in the Memphis movement is Etorre Sottsass, and rightly so. Sottsass founded the movement through his creation of Memphis Group or Memphis Milano, a design group which produced fabrics, furniture, carpets, ceramics, glass and other objectsâ€”through his company, Sottsass and other Italian designers led the Memphis movement to prominence. Indeed, the movement quickly became popular before dying down equally fast. Memphis designers aimed to create products that deviated from conventional styling while still being functional. Products that were both playful and new. They achieved this through the use of shocking bright colours, unusual patterning, shapes, stripes and contrast between both hues of colours and odd shapes. While many people enjoyed this new creative style, some ridiculed the movement. Regardless, Memphis introduced many things to design, from plastic laminate to how designers mocked traditions, too, even how we think about shape and colour.
